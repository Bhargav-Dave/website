# Responsible Data Collection and Sharing from Closed Messaging Apps
## A Checklist 
(*Last Updated*: March 11, 2021)

One of Tattle's goals is to archive viral content from closed messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram. In entering groups on closed messaging apps, researchers and developers must be mindful to not treat these groups as public by default. People sign up on messaging apps using their phone numbers which could identify them. Surfacing data from these groups, without adequate concerns about user safety, could put chat app users at risk. 

This is an evolving check-list of design decisions that must consider **before** beginning any data collection from chat apps. For a more detailed background on ethics of research on closed messaging apps, please see the paper: *[Ethical Approaches to Closed Messaging Messaging Research- Considerations in Democratic Contexts]*(https://)

The design choices in setting up the data collection process from closed messaging apps can be broken down into five main stages: 

1. Signing Up on the App: 
  > *  Under what name should researchers sign up on the app?
  > *  Whom is the phone number registered to?

2. Discovering Relevant Groups: 
  > *  How are chat groups discovered and selected for research?

3. After Joining a Group: 
  > *  How, if at all, should researchers disclose their presence?
  > *  When should researchers decide to leave the group?

4. Extracting/Collating Data from the app
  > *  Through what technical means is the data extracted from the app?
  > *  What Deidentification and anonymization techniques are applied to the data?
  > *  How, if at all, is the data backed-up?

5. Reproducibility
  > *  Should the source of code used for data extraction be opened?
  > *  Should links to groups studied be shared widely?
