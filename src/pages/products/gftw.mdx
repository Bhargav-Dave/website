## Introduction to the Study

Any reconceptualization of the Internet requires rethinking of incentives not only for content creation but also for content discovery and 
amplification. Academic and civic attention has been devoted to platforms’ amplification algorithms. But in countries such as India, content is 
amplified in closed messaging apps such as WhatsApp even in absence of platform enabled amplification. The lack of centralised moderation makes the
information consumers the primary line of defence against low quality information. A point of interest in such a conundrum is the implication 
that people are highly susceptible to misinformation.

Social media and other informational platforms can be considered networked social systems with public goods, where the truth can be considered 
a public good. Information sharing can also be driven through social, legal, and financial incentives. Keeping these in mind, we aim to understand 
whether incentivizing people to share “good” and factual content and disincentivizing the sharing of misinformation, either through micropayments 
or through social feedback, reduces the sharing of misinformation.

Tattle in partnership with [Monk Prayogshala](https://www.monkprayogshala.in/) will execute this project. It is funded by [Grant for the Web](https://www.grantfortheweb.org/)

## Study Design and Procedure

First, participants responded to a demographic form, a short questionnaire, and a bot test. Those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 
consented to participate were invited to participate in the experiment. Participants were provided with a total of 25 messages, five messages 
on the first day (baseline) and ten each on two days after that. The order of the messages was randomised and counterbalanced. That is, all
participants were provided with all five types of messages across the three days: plausible, implausible, true, false, and ‘wholesome.’ For more
information on how this content was created, you can refer to [this blog](https://tattle.co.in/blog/content-creation-for-the-meshi-information-sharing-experiment)
After this, participants were provided with Qualtrics including post-task questions.

## Current Progress

We have made considerable progress on the following 2 deliverables:

- Open source code to replicate study. We have been documenting all progress on our study here - [Github Repository]([https://github.com/orgs/tattle-made/projects/18](https://github.com/tattle-made/Comparative-Study-of-Various-Incentives-and-their-effect-on-Content-Sharing-Behaviour/)). The psychological study part of our project is complete. We are analysing the collected data now.
- Open Source Software for self hosted feed based social network with web monetization built in. We've prototyped payments via the Rafiki testnet.

The 2 remaining deliverables include publications around our study which will happen after we have analyzed the results of our study. Stay tuned for updates!
