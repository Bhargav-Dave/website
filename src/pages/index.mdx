# Accurate Information to the People

Tattle is a civic tech project that aims to make accurate information more accessible to mobile first users, in languages that they are comfortable with.

To this end, Tattle is creating an open archive of content circulated on chat apps; and building open source data collection tools and APIs to index and query the multimedia archive.

You can read more about the project [here](/faq).

Tattle was one of the winners of the [AI and the News Open Challenge](https://aiethicsinitiative.org/news/2019/3/12/announcing-the-winners-of-the-ai-and-the-news-open-challenge) which has enabled the project to scale faster.
