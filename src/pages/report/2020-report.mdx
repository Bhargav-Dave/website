## Making Sense of a Pandemic

Tattle turned one on March 25 2020. This was also the day that India announced a nationwide lockdown, to slow down spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the country. Tattle's second year is bookended by the first and second wave of Coronavirus in India. Remote work, social isolation, personal and collective tragedies warped our sense of time in this one year. For a group like Tattle, working on misinformation, there was no dearth of content or problem statements to drown in. Looking back, some events from 2020 feel like they happened eons ago. Others feel like they happened yesterday.

The year had its ebbs and flows. Some periods were very busy, with every person working on multiple projects in parallel. Some periods were slower, where we grappled with farcical legal notices from platforms in India. All of it was valuable learning in the process of turning two.

This report provides a snapshot of what turning two in the year of the pandemic meant for Tattle. This report needs to be prefaced with Tattle's goal, which is _to build datasets and tools to enable storytelling and response to misinformation in India_. Products and research were pursued in line with this goal.

## Tools Built

- [Tattle Khoj](https://services.tattle.co.in/khoj/): a service that tells you if an image has appeared in a fact-checking article.
- WhatsApp Scraper

## Research

- We created a dataset on '[Prioritizing User Generated Multi-Media Content for Fact-Checking'](https://Prioritizing User Generated Multi-Media Content for Fact-Checking). This dataset was motivated by our need to identify content that can be fact checked in the troves of data we collect. Showing the million plus posts unfiltered on Kosh wouldn't serve the purpose of the archive which is to help people understand misinformation related trends on social media in India. This dataset can help train machine learning models for parsing content that contains factual claims and thus can be fact checked.

  This dataset was accepted at [ICWSM 2021](https://icwsm.org/2021/#accepted_papers). The peer review process gives us confidence that our methodology can be extended to create larger datasets. One of our findings from creating this dataset was that 28% of memes contain factual claims. In separate work we will also explore the importance of incorporating memes and consequently narratives in [IFCN style fact-checking work](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-and-fact-checkers-fight-fake-news).

- We co-authored a paper on '[Ethical Approaches to Closed Messaging Research: Considerations in Democratic Contexts](https://electionstandards.cartercenter.org/verifying-elections-misinfocon2020/ethical-approaches-to-closed-messaging-research-considerations-in-democratic-contexts/)', released by the Carter Center and Misinfocon. This paper discusses issues of user consent, privacy and data governance in research on WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram.
- We presented our work on: "**A Case Study of Platform-Seeded Trends and Non/Algorithmic Paternalism from India** "at the [Annual Conference of the Platform Governance Research Network](https://www.platgov.net/program.pdf). This work describes analysis of Indian social media platform.

## Community Use Cases:

The Fact Checking Sites Database was requested by over 30 researchers and journalists. The following academic papers, media reports used this data:

- Misinformation as a Window into Prejudice: COVID-19 and the Information Environment in India, CSCW, Syeda Zainab Akbar, Anmol Panda, Divyanshu Kukreti, Azhagu Meena, Joyojeet Pal
- The strange, sometimes sinister conspiracy theories on Sushant Singh Rajputâ€™s death that flourished on social media. Venkat Ananth, ET Times
- Coronavirus: The human cost of fake news in India. Shruti Menon, BBC Reality Check
- Increase in Communal Tone in COVID-19 Fake News in India: Study. Syeda Zainab Akbar, Divyanshu Kukreti, Somya Sagarika, Joyojeet Pal (University of Michigan)
- Temporal Patterns in COVID-19 misinformation in India. Syeda Zainab Akbar, Divyanshu Kukreti, Somya Sagarika, Joyojeet Pal (University of Michigan)

The Social Media Datasets have been shared with a few academics. We hope to see academic papers based on this dataset in the coming months. \
