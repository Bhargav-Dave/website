# Privacy Policy

Tattle aims to make verified information more easily accessible to mobile first users, in languages that they are comfortable with. 

Tattle is an open source project. One of its goals is to create an open archive of content circulated on chat apps. Consequently, Tattle does not collect name, phone numbers, or any other personal data of individual users. Tattle does store the time stamp at which a particular message was shared. 

The Android App gives users the option to share a coarse location (IP location) since it doesnâ€™t identify any user and can be used for trends analysis. The following section further explains the working of the android app. 

Data Collected By Android App
## About Tattle App
The Android App is to allow anonymous crowdsourcing, and annotating of messages forwarded on WhatsApp from WhatsApp users.

## What Tattle collects about users:
Besides the content users share with the app, it stores the time at which the post was submitted to the app. While submitting, the location from where the message is being shared is selected by default, but a user can opt out of this prior to submission of a post. This location is that given by your Internet service provider (not GPS).

## Why Tattle needs this information?
The three data points- content, time and location enable for deeper understanding of trends on information dissemination on WhatsApp such as:

Where do posts originate from?

Do WhatsApp videos have a shelf life or are they recycled and forwarded in newer forms?

What kind of content is circulated on WhatsApp and how is it received?

The crowdsourced data will be open-access and can be used by researchers studying spread of information and misinformation on encrypted platforms such as WhatsApp. The data will also be valuable for online information verification groups.

## Control over information:
Tattle does not collect any personal information on the user. Any user can request for access to the data being collected by the app through the contact email id.
