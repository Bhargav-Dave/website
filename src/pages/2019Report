### Tattle is building open tools and datasets for increasing the reach of accurate information to mobile first audiences, and for enabling greater understanding of information trends on chat apps and social media. 


##Stock Taking

While we started working on Tattle in 2018, Tattle was legally incorporated in 2019. The organization completed its first year as a legal entity on March 25th 2020. 

Tattle very purposefully chose to be an open source project. We believe transparency is critical to build trust in the work we do. And trust is vital for a project aiming to address challenges of abundant and misleading information. 

In this annual report we list all that we have done through the last one year. Through writing this we realized- we are only just getting started. 


We hired the first full time employee in September 2019. Now, Tattle is supported by three full time staff members and a network of volunteers and interns. 

This March, we shared the [Stakeholder Map](https://tattle-media.s3.amazonaws.com/stakeholder_map.png) that we came up with in early 2019. This map helps ground our brainstorming sessions on citizen driven action against misinformation. Amongst all these different stakeholders, Tattle focuses on three:
  * Everyday misinformation warriors
  * Fact-checking groups
  * Researchers

In this first year, Tattle’s work has been most useful for researchers. For example, researchers have used the fact-checking sites dataset that Tattle has released for understanding [Covid specific trends](http://joyojeet.people.si.umich.edu/an-archive-of-covid-19-related-fake-news-in-india/). In 2020, we’ll focus on adding more datasets and building tools that fact-checking groups can use out-of-the box. All the while, we’ll be adding more functionalities for motivated chat app users to search through the archive in Indian languages and through different modalities (video, audio, mixed-media). 



## What We’ve Built:
* [Tattle Khoj](https://services.tattle.co.in/khoj/): a search service to find stories on Fact Checking sites that have referenced the image.
* [TattleJod bot](https://t.me/TattleJodBot): A telegram bot that lets individuals tag and push content to the Tattle archive.
* [Tattle Archive](http://shell.tattle.co.in/): The main archive for annotating and organizing the data. 
* Data Collection:
  * Released datasets containing text, images and videos checked and referenced by six fact checking sites.
  * Built tech for scraping WhatsApp groups.
