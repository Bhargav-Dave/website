## Tinkerer/Technical Specialist
Tattle is building an archive of content circulated on chat apps. This requires us to collect messages from different chat platforms through a variety of methods such as scraping, customized bots and a mobile phone app. This requires creative tinkering with both hardware (such as Android phones) and software; and a keen curiosity about social media and chat apps. Tattle is looking for a technical specialist to support its data collection.
